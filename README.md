# I am writing our Shadow Resume: the intangible intelligence that emerges when known paths have been depleted.  

**The Problem:**

**Current AI models flag divergence as error:**

 • the baker's thumb that knows when pie crust is too brittle 

 • the driver who overrides GPS because the receiving dock is around the corner
 
 • the carpenter's cut just above the specification to account for a knot.  

**STATUS: all flagged as "human error"**

      We contribute this integlligence every day, but rarely notice, rarely name: our Shadow Resume.

**The Project:** 
I am exploring what happens when we narrate this intelligence to AI models.  
# By encoding our intangible intelligence, we found the enhanced model scanned for human intelligence before it flagged "error".

**The Repository:**

*  **Dataset:** Annotated Narratives 
*  **Protocol:** Visibility to adaptive human reasoning
*  **Goal:** To enhance models to weigh expertise in giving the user actionable support.
