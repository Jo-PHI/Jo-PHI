# I am writing our Shadow Resume: the intangible intelligence that emerges when known paths have been depleted.  

# The baker's thumb that knows when pie crust is too brittle.  The driver who overrides GPS because the receiving dock address is around the corner.  The carpenter's straight cut just above a knot, but above the specification. ---> All human errors. Flagged.  

# We contribute this integlligence every day, but rarely notice, rarely name.  These is our Shadow Resume.

# I am exploring what happens when we narrate this intelligence to AI models.  Using notes to narrate indescribable aspects of human intelligence - like expertise and experience - the enhanced model did not immediately flag "human error".  Instead, it consdered whether there might be another intelligence it could not see.  

# What does this mean that a writer could enhance a model to weigh expertise in an optimization task?
