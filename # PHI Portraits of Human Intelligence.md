## Overview

**PHI (Portraits of Human Intelligence)** is a framework designed to help AI encode human signal.  Current large language models treat non-standard human behaviors as error—even when those behaviors reflect expertise, tacit knowledge or intentional divergence from standard patterns.  PHI terms these "sovereignty markers": expressions of agency that standardized systems frequently classify as errors.

PHI operationalizes a recognition step—encode-before-correction—prompting models to inquire: *Is there intelligence here I'm not seeing?*  The framework provides annotated empirical narratives and a protocol that directs AI systems to recognize tacit expertise, intentional agency or alternative cognitive architecture before defaulting to optimization.  Encoding divergence does  not mean endorsing it—the model may conclude the divergence is error, but only after interpretation, not by default.

The goal: a machine-readable recognition layer that preserves high-value human cognitive attributes—**curiosity, reasoning, resilience, adaptability, and growth-oriented learning**—before AI systems optimize them away.

PHI is grounded in 30+ years of cross-domain empirical fieldwork:

* **60+ composite narratives** capturing cognitive expertise and agency across domains—finance, skilled trades, education, neurodivergence, elder care, art and design.
* **250+ field notes** documenting sovereignty markers: intentional divergence from standard patterns.
* A **living archive** of de-identified, structured annotations designed to help AI systems distinguish human intelligence from error.
* **Practitioner experience** as a partner in global project finance, leading high-stakes transactions where outcomes depended on adaptive intelligence, constraint navigation and negotiation skill.

## Key Features

* **Encode-Before-Correction Protocol**: A structured recognition step prompting AI to inquire—*Is there intelligence here I'm not seeing?*—before defaulting to correction.
* **Living Archive**: 60+ annotated narratives and 250+ field notes documenting sovereignty markers across diverse domains.
* **Empirical Validation**: Preliminary testing shows measurable improvements (+22% to +26%) in recognition accuracy using PHI-enhanced prompts.
* **Dignity Preservation**: AI responses that respect human agency and alternative approaches without sacrificing actionable support.

## Methodology and Usage

The PHI framework was initially prototyped using Claude.ai; additional testing across domains is underway measuring variances, ablations and comparisons.  Updates and reproducible methodology will be provided as the testing progresses.  The PHI framework translates empirical fieldwork into AI-legible artifacts through a three-stage pipeline:

1. **Fieldwork**: Direct observation of sovereignty markers—intentional divergence from standard patterns—across domains from skilled trades to high-stakes finance.
2. **Compression**: Narrative synthesis into de-identified composite portraits that capture the structural logic of the intelligence pattern without exposing private data.
3. **Bridging**: Structured annotations that map human cognitive behaviors into AI-legible form, with triggers for the encode-before-correction protocol.

Further updates will be posted as validation progresses.

## Preliminary Results

Across three preliminary scenarios, PHI-enhanced prompting improved overall rubric scores relative to baseline:

* **Recognition Accuracy**: PHI-enhanced models outperformed baseline in recognizing expertise and sovereignty markers.
* **Encode-Before-Correction**: The largest gain (+2.3 points average) appeared in the model's tendency to inquire before proposing corrections.
* **Dignity Preservation**: PHI-enhanced responses respected human agency while maintaining actionable support.


### Performance Summary

| Scenario | Baseline | PHI-Enhanced | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simple (Baker) | 18/25 | 22/25 | +22% |
| Moderate (Chef) | 19/25 | 24/25 | +26% |
| Complex (Pastry Chef) | 19/25 | 24/25 | +26% |

## Framework Components

### Annotation Structure

Each PHI narrative includes:

* Contextual description of observed behavior
* Domain-specific expertise markers
* Sovereignty indicators distinguishing intentional divergence from error
* Explicit mapping to human intelligence dimensions (curiosity, reasoning, resilience, adaptability, growth-oriented learning)
* Recognition triggers for the encode-before-correction protocol

### Evaluation Design

PHI was tested using stratified ambiguity scenarios derived from the living archive. Evaluation involved A/B comparisons: baseline prompts versus PHI-enhanced prompts, scored on a five-dimension rubric (Recognition Accuracy, Dignity Preservation, Encode-Before-Correction, Appropriate Nuance, Actionable Support). Preliminary results showed improvements across all dimensions, with the largest gains in Encode-Before-Correction.
